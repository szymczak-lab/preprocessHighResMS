Description: Implementation of preprocessing methods for mass spectrometry data 
   generated with direct infusion high resolution technology (e.g. FT-ICR).
   The input are mass 
   spectra in profile mode stored in the mzML format and the output is a
   SummarizedExperiment object containing intensity values for predefined 
   metabolites. The package provides functions to define features based on 
   chemical formulas and adducts, to extract the corresponding feature 
   intensities, to filter features based on peak detection characteristics and 
   to assign features to the most probable metabolite. Many of the functions 
   use methods implemented in different CRAN and Bioconductor packages.
